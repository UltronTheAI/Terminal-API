# Terminal API

## Introduction
The Terminal API is a Flask-based application that provides an interface for executing commands in a terminal-like environment. It is designed to be used by AI systems that need to interact with a terminal or command line interface.

## Installation
Before running the app, you need to install the required Python packages. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the App
To run the Terminal API, navigate to the directory containing the script and run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python app.py
```

The API will start running on `localhost` at port `5000`.

## Usage
To use the Terminal API, send HTTP requests to the appropriate endpoints with the required JSON objects. 

Please note that this API is intended for use by AI systems and should not be exposed to untrusted clients, as it allows arbitrary command execution. Always ensure that the API is secured appropriately.
